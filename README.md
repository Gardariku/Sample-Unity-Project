# Sample-Unity-Project
This is a sample project demonstrating my current skill with unity. Main idea is to implement a simple match-three game, but in order to make things spicier it uses chess figures and their movement rules.

Future plans:
1) Inject dependencies with Zenject, instead of manual method calls and inspector links.
2) Effects for possible moves and highlight selected cell.
3) Score count, mb add timer or smth.
4) UI for score/timer and tooltips.
5) Startup menu (with possibility to start different game modes later).
6) Think about adding some interesting interesting as background.
X) Multiplatform support (at least mobile).
X) New cells/items/buffs mechanics
X) Sounds, particles, etc.
